Version 0.3.6

This version contains support for radios using the Si570 DDS chip as VFO.  For example, in various
SoftRock radios, like the RxTx Ensemble.  A pure Python USB interface is provided that requires the
libusb-1.0 wrapper from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libusb1/1.2.0 .

The current edition of the supplementary material for the QST article is now provided in the GIT repository
and in the downloadable zip file in ODT (Open Document Text) and PDF (Portable Document) formats.

Version 0.3.0

The enclosed file "TPP_qst_suppl_2014_04a.odt" (with .pdf and .doc versions) is an expanded version of the article printed in QST (April, 2014).  It has been updated, but it is probably not quite current, since the project has continued in development after publication.
